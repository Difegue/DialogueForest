# DialogueForest  

DialogueForest is an Outliner tool that is focused towards writing game dialogue: You can easily write multiple long text exchanges in a node, then link said node to other ones through VN-style prompts.  
I wrote this tool as I wasn't satisfied with any existing software to write text/dialogues for my games (my best functioning setup was an excel sheet with macros so you can guess how messy that was).  
As such, it's laid out in a very personal way, but I thought I'd release it if it can help anyone else.  

Current Features:  

- Write Dialogue Nodes with multiple text blocks and customizable per-block characters, and link them to each other through prompts  
- Store your nodes in Dialogue Trees, where they can be displayed either as cards or in tree form  
- Pin nodes to access them in one easy list  
- Automatically saves your work, even if the app is closed  
- Rich text support  
- Set predefined characters to easily use when writing  
- Set custom metadata for dialogue nodes, either strings, colors or booleans  
- Export your Trees to JSON, with rich text formatted using either HTML, Markdown or BBCode  
- Basic daily word objective functionality with notifications and streak counting
